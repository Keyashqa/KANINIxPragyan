YDHYA — AI TRIAGE FOR INDIA'S FORGOTTEN HOSPITALS
Video Script | 4:00–4:30 | Global Hackathon Submission

========================================================
[0:00–0:30] THE HOOK — A STORY THAT DEMANDS ATTENTION
========================================================

[Open on a stark visual — a crowded district hospital corridor, or a simple text card fading in]

NARRATOR:

"Lakshmi Devi is seventy-two. She walks into a district hospital in rural Tamil Nadu complaining of dizziness and fatigue. She's diabetic. Her blood pressure is elevated. The one doctor on duty sees thirty more patients waiting outside. He checks her vitals, writes 'general weakness,' and sends her home with paracetamol.

Three hours later, Lakshmi collapses. She was having a silent heart attack.

Forty percent of heart attacks in elderly diabetic women present like this — no chest pain, no dramatic symptoms. Just dizziness. Just fatigue. And in a hospital with one doctor, no CT scan, and the nearest cardiologist a hundred kilometers away... Lakshmi never had a chance.

This is not a rare story. This is the reality for six hundred million Indians served by sub-urban district hospitals."

"We built Ydhya to make sure Lakshmi gets the right diagnosis — even when there's no specialist in the building."

========================================================
[0:30–1:15] THE PROBLEM — WHY THIS MATTERS
========================================================

[Show problem stats — text cards or simple infographics]

NARRATOR:

"India's healthcare system has a brutal gap. At the top — world-class hospitals in metros. At the bottom — district hospitals serving hundreds of thousands of people with one or two doctors and basic equipment. No cardiologist. No neurologist. No pulmonologist.

Here's what that means in practice:

A triage nurse sees a patient with chest pain and shortness of breath. Is it cardiac? Is it pulmonary? Could it be a pulmonary embolism masquerading as anxiety? These are questions that take years of specialist training to answer — and in a district hospital, no one with that training is available.

The result? Under-triage. Missed emergencies. Patients sent home who should have been referred. And by the time they reach a tertiary hospital — if they reach one — it's often too late.

Ydhya changes that equation entirely."

========================================================
[1:15–2:15] THE SOLUTION — HOW YDHYA WORKS
========================================================

[Transition to product walkthrough — screen recording of the app]

NARRATOR:

"Ydhya puts an AI-powered medical council inside every district hospital.

Here's how it works. A nurse enters the patient's data — name, age, vitals, symptoms, pre-existing conditions. One click — 'Begin Triage.'

Behind the scenes, a pipeline of seven AI agents activates.

First — the Ingest Agent normalizes the raw data into a structured clinical format.

Second — a trained XGBoost machine learning model classifies the patient's risk level. This is pure ML — no hallucination risk, deterministic, and explainable with seventy-seven engineered features covering vitals, symptoms, and comorbidities.

Then — and this is the breakthrough — a Specialist Council of five AI physicians activates in parallel. A cardiologist, a neurologist, a pulmonologist, an emergency medicine physician, and a general internist. Each one is powered by Google Gemini, grounded with hundreds of lines of clinical reasoning frameworks specific to their specialty.

You can watch them think in real time. Each specialist independently evaluates the patient, scores relevance and urgency on a zero-to-ten scale, raises red flags and yellow flags, recommends tests, and decides whether to claim primary ownership.

And here's what makes this medically responsible — every specialist prompt enforces what we call Rule Zero: absolute data integrity. The AI can only reference symptoms and vitals that actually exist in the patient record. It cannot hallucinate findings. It cannot invent an examination it never performed. If data is insufficient, it says so honestly. In medicine, a fabricated diagnosis is far more dangerous than saying 'I don't know.'

Finally — the Chief Medical Officer agent synthesizes all six opinions into a single verdict: final risk level, primary department, safety alerts, a consolidated workup plan with de-duplicated tests, and an actionable recommendation."

========================================================
[2:15–3:00] THE DEMO — SEEING IT IN ACTION
========================================================

[Screen recording — full triage flow]

NARRATOR:

"Let me show you. We're entering a patient — seventy-two-year-old female, diabetic, hypertensive. Symptoms: dizziness and weakness. BP one-fifty-five over ninety-five. Heart rate ninety-five. SpO2 ninety-four percent.

[Click 'Begin Triage' — SSE panel starts streaming]

Watch the pipeline stream. The classification agent flags medium risk. Now the specialist council activates — all five evaluating simultaneously.

[Specialist opinions appear one by one in the log]

The cardiologist raises a yellow flag — 'elderly diabetic at risk for atypical MI.' The pulmonologist flags the borderline SpO2 — ninety-four percent in a seventy-two-year-old is not normal. The emergency physician flags the under-triage risk pattern. General medicine claims primary and orders foundational labs.

[Navigate to Result page]

The CMO verdict lands. Risk level: Medium, adjusted upward. Priority score: sixty-two. Primary department: General Medicine. Secondary: Cardiology. Recommended action: Urgent.

[Show Council page with radar chart]

On the council view — you see the radar chart mapping each specialist's relevance and urgency. You see their individual assessments, their flags, their recommended workups.

[Show Workup tab]

The consolidated workup merges tests from all specialists — a twelve-lead ECG ordered by both Cardiology and Emergency Medicine gets de-duplicated and escalated to STAT priority.

[Show Queue page]

And on the patient queue — every triaged patient ranked by priority score. The district hospital now has an intelligent waiting list."

========================================================
[3:00–3:40] TECHNICAL DEPTH & DIFFERENTIATION
========================================================

NARRATOR:

"Let me highlight what makes Ydhya technically distinctive.

One — hybrid AI architecture. We combine deterministic machine learning for risk classification with LLM-powered specialist reasoning. The ML model provides the baseline. The specialists provide the nuance. Neither alone is sufficient.

Two — parallel agent execution using Google ADK. Six specialists reason simultaneously and independently — no cascade bias, no groupthink. Consensus and dissent emerge naturally, just like in a real medical council.

Three — real-time Server-Sent Events streaming. The frontend receives every pipeline event as it happens — classification, each specialist opinion, the final verdict. The nurse watches the AI think.

Four — district hospital grounding. Every specialist prompt is calibrated for resource-limited settings. They know there's no CT scanner. They know a referral means a hundred-kilometer journey. Recommendations are practical, not theoretical.

Five — WhatsApp integration. The same pipeline is accessible via WhatsApp — a nurse can send patient data or a PDF report and receive a formatted triage verdict on their phone. No app installation required.

And six — explainability at every layer. Contributing factors, confidence scores, council consensus measurement, dissenting opinions — everything is transparent and auditable."

========================================================
[3:40–4:15] IMPACT & VISION
========================================================

NARRATOR:

"The impact is measurable.

A district hospital doctor seeing forty patients a day now has an AI council that catches atypical presentations — the silent MI in an elderly diabetic woman, the posterior circulation stroke presenting as simple dizziness, the pulmonary embolism hiding behind tachycardia.

Patients who would have been sent home are now flagged for urgent evaluation. Patients who need referral are identified before it's too late — with a consolidated workup that the receiving hospital can act on immediately.

Ydhya doesn't replace doctors. It gives every district hospital the specialist insight that only metro hospitals have today. It's triage equity — ensuring that where you live doesn't determine whether you survive."

========================================================
[4:15–4:25] CLOSING
========================================================

[Return to opening visual or Ydhya logo]

NARRATOR:

"Lakshmi Devi walked into a hospital with dizziness and fatigue. Without Ydhya, she went home. With Ydhya — she gets a cardiologist's suspicion, a pulmonologist's SpO2 analysis, an emergency physician's instinct, and a workup plan that could save her life.

Ydhya. The specialist council that never sleeps."
