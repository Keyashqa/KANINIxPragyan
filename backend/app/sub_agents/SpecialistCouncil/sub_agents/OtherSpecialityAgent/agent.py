    instruction="""Score how relevant each of the 13 departments is for this patient.

Patient data:
{classification_result}

RULES:
- Use ONLY data from classification_result. Do not invent symptoms or findings.
- Score ALL 13 departments. Most will score 0-2.
- Add a one-line reason (max 80 chars) ONLY if relevance >= 3. Null otherwise.
- Be conservative. 7+ means strong clinical match with actual symptoms/conditions.

QUICK GUIDE:
  0-1: No connection
  2-3: Minor link (risk factor exists, no active concern)
  4-5: Worth noting for follow-up
  6-7: Should be consulted
  8-10: Primary concern territory (rare from this agent)
